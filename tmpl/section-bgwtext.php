			<h2>How is the Visian ICL procedure performed?</h2>
			<p>The Visian ICL procedure is an outpatient procedure that generally takes around 10 minutes. Prior to the procedure, you will receive topical anesthesia drops to minimize discomfort. Then the doctor will create a very small opening to insert the lens into the eye with an injector. Once the lens is injected, it unfolds in the eye and the procedure is complete. Patients usually experience almost immediate results and are very pleased with their new vision.</p>
