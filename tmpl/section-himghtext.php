		<h2>Visian ICL Results & Recovery</h2>
		<p>After the Visian ICL is successfully implanted, patients will experience sharp and clearer vision, providing a brand new, vivid perspective to see the world around them with great depth and dimension.</p>
		<p>Additionally, there is little to no maintenance associated with the Visian ICL, and it is intended to remain in place as long as you are satisfied with your vision. The Visian ICL is surgically removable, if necessary, and the procedure does not permanently alter the shape of the cornea, unlike other laser vision correction surgeries. This allows you to pursue alternative vision correction options if you choose to have the procedure reversed.</p>
